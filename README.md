# CallForFire

# Overview

I enlisted as a 13F in the Idaho Army National Guard and that job's main responsibility is something called call for fire. Call for fire is 
pretty straightforward; is is a radio call for mortars, artilley, or even airstrikes to go where you tell them to. This is an important
job because it can save the lives of yuo and everyone you are with, but also can take your life if you are not paying attention to detail.
I wrote this code as a simulator of what a 13F does when calling for fire.

I used classes, methods, and variables in the C# langugage to write this code.

I wrote this code to give people a small idea of the details that go into calling for fire. Most people have no idea what that even means,
so I wanted to give people a taste of this essential Army job.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work



- I want to add more featues that require user input
- I want to make it more detailed and more accurate to the actual process by lengthening the adjustment phase.
